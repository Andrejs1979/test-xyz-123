# Project Instructions

## Session Start - READ THIS FIRST

**CRITICAL**: At the start of EVERY session, you MUST read the planning documents:

1. **Read docs/PRD.md** - Contains project requirements (READ THIS FIRST!)
2. **Read docs/PROGRESS.md** - Shows current sprint status and what to work on next
3. **Skim docs/EPICS.md** - User stories and acceptance criteria
4. **Skim docs/ARCHITECTURE.md** - Technical design decisions

Without reading these files, you won't know what this project is about or what to work on.

After reading, report the project status and ask what to work on next.
